# Forking and Cloning in Github

We've set up our coding environment, so let's get coding! We will be taking files from the Coder.new Github, copying them to our own Github (**Forking**), and then transfering them to our Cloud9 (**Cloning**) so we can work on them. Sound confusing? Well, lucky for you we're here to guide you along.

For the sake of this example we will be attemping to fork and clone a repository called "Fork_and_clone" from the Coder.new Github.

Firstly, we need to open the github repository. Once you do that you should see a screen like the one below. Notice how in the top left corner it says "**Coderdotnew**/fork_and_clone. This means that the repository is located in Coderdotnew's github. 

Next step is to click "fork" as indicated in the picture.

You will then be asked where you would like to fork your respository. Select your username.

Cool. You just forked in Github for the first time! Notice how the top left file name now says your username and not coderdotnew's username.

Next, we want to clone the repository to your cloud9. Cloning allows the user to access their github repositories on their text editor (Cloud9) so that they can work on them. You do this by first selecting the big, green button on the right.

This pop-up will then appear. It is **Super** important that the first thing you do is click the "Use HTTPS" link. There is a complex reason for this that we won't get into right now, but if you want to know more just ask one of your instructors.

The pop-up's title should then appear as "Clone with HTTPS". You want to then click the small button on the right to copy the link onto your clipboard. Once this is done we are going to move to our terminal on Cloud9.

In the terminal, we need to change into the directory where you want to put your newly forked repository into (in my case: cd example/). Once we cd into our desired directory you simply type "git clone", paste the link you copied on github, and click enter.

You will then be prompted to enter credentials. Type in your username and password for github.

**note: When you type in your password, nothing will appear to happen/show up. Just keep typing.**

Cool. First clone done!

Now that we are done cloning and forking our repository we can now see that the two files have been copied into our desired directory in our file tree, and are now ready for you to code in them!
